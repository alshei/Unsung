## Unsung

Spring Capstone 2022. An experimental demo made in Unity, featuring custom characters, dialogue system, turn-based battle system, saving/loading, etc. The game only has one ending and must be downloaded as an executable. Use WASD/arrow keys for movement, spacebar to jump, and 'E' to interact with NPCs and the environment.

Current Bugs:

* player jumps after exiting dialogue (build issue(?), this doesn't happen in the editor)
* scenes sometimes don't load properly, or player ends up in the wrong scene after a fight 
  
Future Improvements:

* battle logic is rudimentary, may add complex math
* scaling difficulty as necessary
